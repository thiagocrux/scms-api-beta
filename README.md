# Syphilis Case Management System - BETA (API)

API of a syphilis case management application made with Node.js and TypeScript. This is a BETA version developed for a college assignment.

## Technologies

These are some of the tecnologies used in this project:

- `bcrypt`: A library for hashing passwords securely using the bcrypt algorithm. Protects against brute-force attacks by incorporating salting and slow hashing.
- `commitizen`: A command-line tool that helps you write consistent and properly formatted Git commit messages by providing an interactive prompt.
- `commitlint`: A tool that checks your commits and ensures consistency in version control.
- `cz-conventional-changelog`: An adapter for Commitizen that follows the Conventional Commits specification.
- `dotenv`: A module that loads a `.env` file into `process.env`.
- `express`: A Node.js minimalist framework.
- `husky`: A tool for adding Git hooks to automate tasks like linting, testing, or commits in JavaScript/Node.js projects.
- `jsonwebtoken`: A library for creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT), a secure way to transmit data between parties as a signed token.
- `mongoose`: A Node.js ODM for MongoDB that simplifies data modeling and queries.
- `pino`: A very low overhead Node.js logger.
- `prettier`: A code formatter.
- `ts-node-dev`: Allows you to run TypeScript files directly without pre-compilation, automatically restarting the server when changes are detectedâ€”ideal for rapid development.
